# Random_Walk_Simulation
Write a program that simulates a Random Walk using the DrawingPanel library.
In a random walk, the cursor advances by randomly selecting the next step among 4 directions. You can draw 10 pixels for each step in the progression. The program will end when it reaches predefined iteration number (ex. 100)
Constraint: the road to be taken in the next step should not be the way reached in the previous step. In other words, one of the other 3 directions other than the direction reached previously must be taken randomly.
The following figure shows one run of the program.
